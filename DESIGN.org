** License

Why does this use the [[file:LICENSE][GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3]]?

- User Goals:
  - Easy to obtain
  - Easy to modify and redistribute
- Design Logic:
  - [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]] is the dominant package distribution system and it requires packages to use the [[file:LICENSE][GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3]]
  - Most developers want an open source license and specifically GPLv3 which is a license [[https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0][approved by the open source]]
