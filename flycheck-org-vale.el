;; A Laser-Focused Zero-Configuration Single-File Vale Org Syntax Checker.

;;; Code:

(require 'flycheck)

(defun flycheck-org-vale--template-file ()
  "Gets the fully-qualified path of the Vale template.

Finds the source file containing
`flycheck-define-checker--get-template'. Otherwise
`error' notify the user.

This must succeed in order for the package to work.

Note usage of `file-exists-p' instead of `file-readable-p'.

Only the Vale subprocess needs to be able to read the
template file: not Emacs. Although Vale is run as a subprocess
of Emacs: that doesn't ensure that actual `vale' command cannot
read the file. For example `vale' can `sudo' to run
with elevated priviledges making the file readable.

By that logic though should Emacs even check if the file exists
at all? Probably yes because the concept of checking for the
existence of a file requiring less prviledges than the ability
to read it exists and could happen here. That said the
likelihood of this combation (and surely there are many more)
might be low but it is worth checking here to make the user
experience better.

It might feel like an inordinate amount of detail has gone
into this explanation but it is important to justify the choice
made here."
