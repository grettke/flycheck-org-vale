* How To Use

- Configure Emacs for [[https://emacsformacos.com/][macOS]], [[https://caiorss.github.io/Emacs-Elisp-Programming/Emacs_On_Windows.html][Windows]], or any UNIXen. [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/][Here]] is a great book about it.
- Configure [[https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/][Vale]] and add it to your =PATH=. [[file:.vale.ini][Here]] is a sample config for Org and [[https://vale.sh/hub/][here]] are some packages you might enjoy using.
- Configure Emacs Package Archives, MELPA, ~use-package~, and Flycheck in one fell swoop using [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/installation.html][these directions]]. You'll load Flycheck with something like this by the time you finish the setup:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package flycheck
  :ensure t
  :init (global-flycheck-mode))
  #+end_src
- Configure popup error messages:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package flycheck-inline
  :ensure t
  :after flycheck
  :config
  (add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-inline-mode))
  #+end_src
- It isn't released or available on MELPA yet so clone it, add it to your load path, and require it
- Load it like this
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/flycheck-org-vale")
(require 'flycheck-org-vale)
  #+end_src
- Run Flycheck on your file and verify it is working
- You are finished and ready to check all of your Org files!

*Note*: Depending on the size of your Org file Vale can take a few seconds to do its job. Keep writing relaxed and its notifications will always appear at the perfect speed.

* For Developers

See [[file:DESIGN.org][DESIGN]] for design details.
